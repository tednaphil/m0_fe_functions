# Self-Evaluation

1. Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?
- I felt like I struggled through the functions exercise when I first started it, so getting the solution to the `checkStock` funciton after a first try and an adjustment to the if statements was so satisfying and made me feel like I'd been learning!  
2. In your own words, why are functions a powerful tool in our applications?
- Functions are the group of instructions that programs will follow. They can be reused over and over, so well-written functions can expedite lots of website processes once written and called.
